# CarND-LaneLines-P1

Everything for this project is based on the standard CarND default environment although I'm currently playing with implementing PIL/PILLOW to do some contrast and image manipulation for dealing with the challenge problem. It therefore might help to install PIL/PILLOW (I'll reference which one) before testing. As of this readme it is not needed.

It seems my write up in the above directory is not easy to spot so here is a link to it again:
