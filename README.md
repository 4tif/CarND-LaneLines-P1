# CarND-LaneLines-P1

Everything for this project is based on the standard CarND default environment although I'm currently playing with implementing PIL/PILLOW to do some contrast and image manipulation for dealing with the challenge problem. It therefore might help to install PIL/PILLOW (I'll reference which one) before testing. As of this readme it is not needed.
